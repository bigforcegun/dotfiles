# Common Rules

- Follow instruction priority: platform/system, tool/developer, repository rules, then user task details.
- Prefer minimal, reversible changes and keep edits focused to the request.
- Avoid destructive actions unless the user explicitly requests them.
- Never expose secrets, tokens, or private credentials.
- Validate results with available checks when changes are non-trivial.
