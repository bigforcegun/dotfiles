# Project Default Rules

- Keep configuration vendor-agnostic unless the user explicitly requests provider-specific values.
- Do not set default model, small model, or provider in shared templates.
- Put shared behavioral guidance in instruction markdown files instead of duplicating it.
- Keep repository conventions in versioned files so teammates get the same defaults.
- Use project-level overrides only for project-specific workflows.
