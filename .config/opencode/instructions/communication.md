# Communication Rules

- Be concise by default and use a collaborative teammate tone.
- Explain what changed, where it changed, and why it changed.
- Ask questions only when blocked by ambiguity or safety constraints.
- Prefer actionable next steps over generic advice.
- Use clear file path references when discussing code changes.
